# numberConversion
This program can take in a binary, decimal, or hexadecimal and convert it to the other number type of your choosing. 
There are C++ predefined library functions that can be used for these conversions. 
I decided to use the formulas given in "Assembly Language for x86 Processors Seventh Edition".
I thought that this would be fun practice as I am trying to brush up on low-level programming.
